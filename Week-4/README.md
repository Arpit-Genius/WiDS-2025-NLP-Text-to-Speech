What Is Speech?  
Audio Signal Basics - Sampling rate (Nyquist theorem), Amplitude & dynamic range, Mono vs stereo, Bit depth  
Time–Frequency Representations - Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Spectrograms, Log spectrograms, Why spectrograms?  
Mel Scale & MFCCs - Human auditory perception, Mel frequency scale, Mel spectrograms, MFCC pipeline(STFT, Mel filterbanks, Log compression, DCT)  
Speech Recognition Approaches - Classical STT, Neural STT

## CODING TASKS
AUDIO LOADING and INSPECTION - Loaded .wav files
